1./why not going to 100% is there any security for context switching while doing task some are reserverd of something else
2. sir but as we know our browser work on c++ so if we think on our browser our code underlying on c++ and dynamically runs js


let users = ["manu", "pokkie", "hehe"];
console.log(users);
which is better?
for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) console.log(users[i]);

will canVote would be pushed in functions stack like in other language when executed as JS as it is  JIT or something else
